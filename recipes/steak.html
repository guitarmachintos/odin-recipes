  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>200gr ribeye steak</li>
    <li>1tbsp neutral oil</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>1tbsp salt</li>
    <li>1tbsp black pepper</li>
    <li>2tbsp butter</li>
    <li>1 sprig of rosemary</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Take out the steak from the fridge for at least 20 minutes (This step is optional for the end result,
      but it helps reduce oil splatter and easier seasoning).</li>
    <li>Peel the garlic skin and crush them by putting your knife on top of the garlic (not the sharp side),
      and smash them with your hand.
    </li>
    <li>Pat the steak completely dry with paper towel. Use multiple paper towels until there is no moisture left
      in the paper towel. this greatly helps reducing the oil splatter.
    </li>
    <li>Salt the steak (don't add pepper yet) and rub the salt with your hand. Don't miss out a side or a spot.</li>
    <li>Use a heavy or thick bottom pan. Rinse the pan first with water, heat the pan until there is now water left,
      then pour the oil.
    </li>
    <li>Keep heating the oil until it starts to smoke.</li>
    <li>Once the oil started smoking, put the steak in the pan using tong by laying it away from your side to avoid oil splatter.
      You should hear the sizzling (but not too loud). The sizzling means you put it on the right temperature.
    </li>
    <li>After around 3 minutes, flip the steak and check the crust. If it's too dark, don't flip it again.
      If it's too light, flip it again later (not instantly) after cooking the other side. Don't flip the steak too fast 
      (wait for minimum 30s for each side).
    </li>
    <li>The other side should take less time than the previous side because the pan is hotter now (around 2 minutes).
      Then flip the steak again until both sides' crust are to your preference.
    </li>
    <li>After the crust is perfect for you, turn down the heat(not off), then put the butter, garlic and rosemary.</li>
    <li>Now carefully put the steak on the top side of the pan and tilt the pan to your side. Use spoon to scoop the
      now infused butter to baste the steak (pouring the butter on top of the steak). Flip the steak and repeat.
      This process should take around 3 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Take out the steak onto a plate, and rest the steak for at least 5 minutes before cutting.</li>
    <li>After finish resting the steak, cut them around 1 inch thick, and pour the fat from the pan to the steak.</li>
    <li>Enjoy.</li>
